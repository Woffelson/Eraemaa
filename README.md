# ERÆMAA

Erämaa (Wasteland) is basically a tve kvlt artsy walking simulator focused on parallax visuals and drone ambience. This was a short weekend solo project without any meaningful purpose, "a jamless jam". As a test this is also my first project finished with Godot 4 (beta2). Please also note that due to many big background layers the game might be poorly optimised, even though it's a simple game.
